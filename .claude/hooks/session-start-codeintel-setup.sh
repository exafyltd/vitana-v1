# Installs and refreshes the two codebase-intelligence tools CLAUDE.md's
# "Mandatory Codebase Intelligence Workflow" requires (RepoWise, Graphify),
# so that workflow has real tooling behind it at session start instead of
# being an instruction with nothing installed to satisfy it (VTID-04116).
#
# Idempotent by construction: pip/uv installs are no-ops once the package
# is present, and both tools' own "update" commands are incremental
# (tree-sitter/AST re-extraction only touches files that changed since the
# last run) — so a cached container pays the full first-index cost once,
# and every session after that is fast. Never blocks session start on
# failure: a codeintel outage should degrade to "index stale/missing",
# not "session won't open."
#
# VTID-04121 additions:
#   - graphify now gets its "bedrock" extra (boto3) so community clustering
#     can be LABELED with real semantic names via Amazon Bedrock, not left
#     as bare "Community N" placeholders — this session's own AWS
#     credentials (ambient in this remote environment) are enough; Bedrock
#     is this codebase's own standing-mandated LLM path (CLAUDE.md §2b),
#     never Google. If no AWS creds are present, falls back to the
#     unlabeled `--no-cluster` build exactly as before — never blocks.
#   - `repowise hook install` wires the git post-commit auto-sync hook so
#     the index stays current across commits within one session, not just
#     at session start.
#
# VTID-04122 addition:
#   - RepoWise's own LLM synthesis (`get_answer`, `full_upgrade`) has no
#     Bedrock provider at all (confirmed live: REPOWISE_PROVIDER=bedrock
#     throws `ValueError: Unknown provider`) — it needs one of its own
#     supported providers instead (anthropic/openai/openrouter/gemini/
#     deepseek/kimi/...). DeepSeek is the one this platform already
#     provisions a key for elsewhere, so: if this session's environment
#     happens to carry DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, point RepoWise at it explicitly.
#     Never fabricated, never written to a tracked file — this only reads
#     an env var that may or may not be present; when absent, RepoWise
#     behaves exactly as it did before (index/query/context/risk/health/
#     why keep working without prose synthesis; init/update below are
#     structural and unaffected either way).
