# VTID-03464 — Watcher Phase 5: Claude Code session hook
# =============================================================================
# Plan: docs/WATCHER-AGENT-PLAN.md (VTID-03454) Phase 5.
#
# Records what a Claude Code session did onto the Watcher timeline, and at
# session end reconciles the repo state to catch the one failure mode that
# has already cost this project real time:
#
#   CLAUDE.md changelog, 2026-07-29 — VTID-03419 executed a genuine
#   production cutover, and "the doc-update step in VTID-03419's own spec
#   was apparently never pushed before that session's context was
#   summarized." The infrastructure change was real; the paper trail
#   describing it was lost. A later session had to rediscover it.
#
# That is not a code bug and no test would have caught it. It is a session
# that ended with work on disk and nothing pushed — which is exactly what
# this script looks for.
#
# Usage (wired in .claude/settings.json):
#   session-hook.sh start
#   session-hook.sh stop
#
# =============================================================================
# THIS FILE IS A DELIBERATE COPY (VTID-03531)
# =============================================================================
# The original lives at exafyltd/vitana-platform:scripts/watcher/session-hook.sh
# and the two must be kept in sync.
#
# Duplicated rather than shared because a session hook has to work when only
# ONE repo is checked out. Pointing this repo's hook at a path inside the
# platform repo would make frontend sessions silently stop being recorded
# whenever the platform repo is not present — and "silently stops recording"
# is the exact failure this whole subsystem exists to catch. A copy that can
# drift is a smaller problem than a reference that can vanish.
#
# The script itself is repo-agnostic: it reports on whatever git repo
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR points at, so no edits are needed between copies.
#
# =============================================================================
# SAFETY CONTRACT — read before editing
# =============================================================================
#   * Exits 0 ALWAYS. A hook that fails must never fail the session it is
#     observing; an observer that can break the thing it observes is worse
#     than no observer.
#   * Strict no-op when WATCHER_SESSION_TOKEN or the gateway URL is unset.
#     No token means the ingest endpoint is closed anyway (it 503s), so
#     firing would be pure noise.
#   * Never writes to the repo, never stages, never commits, never pushes.
#     It reports; a human decides.
#   * Short curl timeouts. A slow or dead gateway must not hang a session.
# =============================================================================
