# VTID-03464 — Watcher Phase 5: Claude Code session hook
# =============================================================================
# Plan: docs/WATCHER-AGENT-PLAN.md (VTID-03454) Phase 5.
#
# Records what a Claude Code session did onto the Watcher timeline, and at
# session end reconciles the repo state to catch the one failure mode that
# has already cost this project real time:
#
#   CLAUDE.md changelog, 2026-07-29 — VTID-03419 executed a genuine
#   production cutover, and "the doc-update step in VTID-03419's own spec
#   was apparently never pushed before that session's context was
#   summarized." The infrastructure change was real; the paper trail
#   describing it was lost. A later session had to rediscover it.
#
# That is not a code bug and no test would have caught it. It is a session
# that ended with work on disk and nothing pushed — which is exactly what
# this script looks for.
#
# Usage (wired in .claude/settings.json):
#   session-hook.sh start   # SessionStart
#   session-hook.sh end     # SessionEnd   ('stop' accepted as a legacy alias)
#
# =============================================================================
# THIS FILE IS A DELIBERATE COPY (VTID-03531)
# =============================================================================
# The original lives at exafyltd/vitana-platform:scripts/watcher/session-hook.sh
# and the two must be kept in sync.
#
# Duplicated rather than shared because a session hook has to work when only
# ONE repo is checked out. Pointing this repo's hook at a path inside the
# platform repo would make frontend sessions silently stop being recorded
# whenever the platform repo is not present — and "silently stops recording"
# is the exact failure this whole subsystem exists to catch. A copy that can
# drift is a smaller problem than a reference that can vanish.
#
# The script itself is repo-agnostic: it reports on whatever git repo
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR points at, so no edits are needed between copies.
#
#
# =============================================================================
# HOOK CONTRACT — three corrections, VTID-03531
# =============================================================================
# The first version of this script got all three of these wrong. They were
# caught in review of exafyltd/vitana-v1#969 and confirmed against
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks before being fixed here.
#
# 1. THE SESSION ID ARRIVES ON STDIN, NOT IN THE ENVIRONMENT.
#    There is no CLAUDE_SESSION_ID or CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID env var — the
#    documented hook input is a JSON object on stdin carrying session_id.
#    Reading the env var meant this ALWAYS fell through to the adhoc-<sha>
#    fallback, which merges unrelated sessions that share a commit and splits
#    one session into two ids if it commits between start and end.
#
# 2. RECONCILIATION BELONGS ON SessionEnd, NOT Stop.
#    Stop fires once per assistant RESPONSE — many times in a multi-turn
#    session. SessionEnd fires once, when the session terminates. On Stop this
#    posted a 'completed' row after every turn; and because watcher_steps is
#    upserted with ignoreDuplicates, the FIRST write wins, so a dirty tree on
#    turn one would permanently brand a session that ended perfectly clean as
#    a failure. The timeline would have been actively wrong, not merely noisy.
#
# 3. NO UPSTREAM != EVERY COMMIT IS UNPUSHED.
#    `git rev-list --count HEAD` with no upstream counts the entire reachable
#    history, so a fresh clean branch reported thousands of unpushed commits
#    and every reconciliation recorded a false failure. Observed live: 68
#    "unpushed commits" on a branch with one real commit.
#
# =============================================================================
# SAFETY CONTRACT — read before editing
# =============================================================================
#   * Exits 0 ALWAYS. A hook that fails must never fail the session it is
#     observing; an observer that can break the thing it observes is worse
#     than no observer.
#   * Strict no-op when WATCHER_SESSION_TOKEN or the gateway URL is unset.
#     No token means the ingest endpoint is closed anyway (it 503s), so
#     firing would be pure noise.
#   * Never writes to the repo, never stages, never commits, never pushes.
#     It reports; a human decides.
#   * Short curl timeouts. A slow or dead gateway must not hang a session.
